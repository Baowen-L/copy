  <summary><strong>Cultural sources of gender gaps: Confucian meritocracy reduces gender inequalities in political participation</strong>  
</summary>

The historical oppression of women in China mirrors the experiences of women in many other cultures. During the imperial era, Confucian ideologies and institutions played a significant role in perpetuating women's disenfranchisement. This perception has become deeply entrenched, to the extent that contemporary discussions on women's status often automatically refer to lingering Confucian legacies as one of the obstacles to achieving gender equality. However, this study offers a nuanced perspective by shedding light on how certain aspects of Confucianism, notably meritocracy, may serve to empower modern-day women. The research focuses on the Chinese context, particularly the historically significant Confucian-based meritocratic institution known as the civil examination system (keju). I argue that historical meritocratic legacies can have a lasting impact on contemporary behavior, specifically by reducing the gender gap in political participation in local village elections. Using data from historical archives and the China General Social Survey, I find a negative correlation between a prefecture's historical success in the keju exams and the gender gap in village election turnout among present-day respondents. Further exploratory analyses reveal that the enduring Confucian tradition of meritocracy also empowers other low-status social groups, including the economically disadvantaged and the less educated.

  <summary><strong>Linguistic cleavages in public opinion</strong>  
</summary>

Linguistic diversity is a feature of many democratic countries. In a more limited 
number of cases, however, language constitutes a social and political cleavage. Given 
the importance of language in nation-building, such divides often go hand in hand 
with the linguistic minority calling for independence. But how important is the role 
of language, and does it extend beyond a connection with attitudes and opinions 
directly linked with the rights and claims to self-governance of different linguistic 
groups? This chapter first offers an overview of earlier work on language as an indicator 
of social and political differences. In a second section, the chapter zooms in on the 
dividing role of language in public opinion in Belgium and Canada.

  <summary><strong>2017年法国总统大选及政治生态的思考</strong> 
</summary>

2017年法国大选在第五共和国的历史上必将是浓墨重彩的一笔，持续近六十年的政治生态正在经历前所未有的变动。本文首先以党内初选及其失败的结果作为观察视角，分析传统两大政党面临的严峻危机。随后，在经济全球化的背景下探讨反体制势力发展壮大的原因和表现，描绘目前法国政坛的新图景，并对政治格局的未来发展情况做出前瞻性预测——两极化格局解体，三种意识形态相互缠斗。在后大选时代，法国局势仍不会太平。极端势力和街头政治会给马克龙总统的执政带来不少麻烦，而最关键的是，法国社会的政治信任正在消退，这是一切社会稳定、进步的最大绊脚石。法国公民需要承担更多责任，发挥主人翁精神，这或许是解决法国社会问题的一条进路。

  <summary><strong>法国总统马克龙的政治改革</strong> 
</summary>

在全球化的冲击和2008年金融危机所引发的各项社会 
矛盾积累下，法国人民对传统政党政治失去信心，这正 
是马克龙当选总统和推行政治改革的根源。马克龙总统 
任内政治改革的核心思想是提高权力机关的工作效率、 
代表性和责任意识，预计将在2019年通过3个法律文 
件完成。其改革既是第五共和国政治逻辑的延续，又不 
乏新的洞见和举措。改革势必加快旧政治秩序的瓦解， 
推动法国政治生态加速演变，这符合法国人民的期望， 
也符合马克龙总统多数派的政治利益。
