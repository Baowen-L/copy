In April 2024, I successfully defended my doctoral dissertation at the Université de Montréal and earned the highest distinction of “Exceptional”. I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Université du Québec à Montréal, working under the supervision of Professor Allison Harell. I have also been a visiting research fellow at Sciences Po and Waseda University.

My research lies at the intersection of political science and psychology, with a particular focus on the role of culture in shaping political attitudes and behaviors. My PhD dissertation explored the impact of Confucianism on negativity biases and gender gaps in political participation.

I am currently a research fellow at the [Consortium on Electoral Democracy](https://c-dem.ca/) and hold affiliations with the [Center for the Study of Democratic Citizenship](https://csdc-cecd.ca) and the [Laboratoire d’analyse en communication politique et opinion publique (LACPOP)](https://lacpop.uqam.ca/).
